# DSCI 525 Group 7 Project

Authors: Mohammed Abdul Moid, Rada Rudyak, Adrianne Leung, Jessie Wong

### Overall project goal and data
In this project, our team would build and deploy ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~6 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models and the target is the actual rainfall observation. The dataset used is on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681).
